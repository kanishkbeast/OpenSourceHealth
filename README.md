#OpenSourceHealth

There are so many SaaS products out there that make you create an account and pay a certain amount per month. 
Worst of all you have to give your data to some third party.

The purpose of OpenSourceHealth is to create a no BS health tracker to help you track your health over time, with 
the data stored on your device. There will be an option to help tranfer it to your icloud, but that's it. 

I am creating this free iOS application for not only for myself but for others who also want to track their progress in the
gym, and to track other health metrics such as blood test results. 

Why can't you just use the Notes app or a personal journal? I view this app as an extension of the Notes app, with the 
extended capabilities to view your health data in graphical format. What doesn't get tracked doesn't get improved, and 
the ability to see data - such as your bench press weight - change over time will give you a
objective truth if you are improving.
